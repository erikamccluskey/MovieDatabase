# MovieDatabase

A movie database web application that allows users to view and rate movies as well as create personalized watchlists with the movies of their choice.  

Why?  
This project's purpose was to learn JavaScript (specifically form validation and DOM2 event registration), PHP, AJAX, and JSON.  
It is the first PHP web application I built.  

The website is hosted on http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~emm579/movienet/homepage.php.  

You will not be able to run this code on your personal machine.  
The database connection call has been voided for obvious privacy and security reasons.
